### Project 2 - Make Payment App

---

### Problem Statement:
As a Software Engineer, your task is to implement the transferMoney feature for 
a financial application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Start by translating UI 
design specifications from a Figma file, including input fields for sender's account number, transfer amount, recipient's bank name, and narration. 

Then,implement the transferMoney function, ensuring validation of input fields, 
 initiating an asynchronous payment request, and providing immediate user 
 feedback on payment success or failure through the console and alerts.
