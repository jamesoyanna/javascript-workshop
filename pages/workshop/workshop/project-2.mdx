### Asyncronousity in Javascript

### Project 2 - Make Payment App

---

### Problem Statement:
As a Software Engineer, your task is to implement the transferMoney feature for 
a financial application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Start by translating UI 
design specifications from a Figma file, including input fields for sender's account number, transfer amount, recipient's bank name, and narration. 

Then,implement the transferMoney function, ensuring validation of input fields, 
 initiating an asynchronous payment request, and providing immediate user 
 feedback on payment success or failure through the console and alerts.

#### Tips:
- JavaScript, being a single-threaded language, faces limitations in handling concurrent tasks efficiently. 
To overcome this constraint, web browsers utilize additional components - Web Browser APIs, to perform various operations concurrently. 
hese APIs extend the capabilities of JavaScript.

- Tasks that takes time to run in JavaScript, such as complex computations or network requests, can freeze the user interface, making the application less responsive and causing a poor user experience.
