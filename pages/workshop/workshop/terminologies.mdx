# Concepts & Terminologies


## Global & Local Memory 
The global memory is a storage space where your variables find their place.

- When you declare a variable, it gets allocated in the memory of your computer, and its value is stored there.

- Functions, when declared, also get their share of space in this memory stored  as function definition.

## Function:
Functions are bundle of code which are set of instructions that you name and resuse or pass around our application by. They do a specific task when you call or invoke them.

## Thread of Execution: 
The path your JavaScript code takes when it's running. The sequence of running our code line by line:

- The code is executed line by line, from top to bottom.
- Functions are also executed sequentially when called.

## Callstack:
The callstack is a data structure that stores information about your program. It keeps track of where your program is in its execution.

## Execution Context:
Its a workspace where code is evaluated and executed. It's the environment that holds all the necessary information for a particular piece of code to run.
When a function is called, a new execution context is created.

## Callback Queue:
The Callback Queue is a data structure in the JavaScript runtime environment that manages asynchronous callbacks.
They handle tasks that are not part of the synchronous call stack, such as events, timers, and I/O operations.

## Microtask Queue:
 Is a queue that holds tasks with higher priority than regular tasks in the Callback Queue. 
 They are often associated with promises and other asynchronous operations.

 ## Eventloop:
The event loop ensures that your JavaScript code, with all its asynchronous operations, runs smoothly. 

It manages the order in which tasks are executed, making sure everything happens at the right time.
It constantly checks the Call Stack to see if it's empty. 

If it's empty, it looks at the Task Queue.
If there's something in the Task Queue, it moves it to the Call Stack for execution.
