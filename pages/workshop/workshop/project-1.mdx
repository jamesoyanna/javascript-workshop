#### Tips:
- In javascript, We run our code line by line and we store data in memory.

- Function have 2 phases - the declaration phase  and the invocation phases.

- Javascript is a single threaded language meaning that it can only do one thing at a time.

- Software engineering is all about taking data and storing it inside the memory and running functionality on the data.
