## Introduction
 Hi there welcome to Javascript Advance Part  1.
I am James, a Software Engineer.  I run DevsCourt, a fast-growing developer community. We are on a mission to raise exceptional software engineering talents who are technically proficient, collaborative, and passionate about driving the industry forward.

This technical workshop is brought to you by Devscourt Developer Community [DevsCourt](https://devscourt.com/):

In this workshop, we are going to take a deep dive into the principles of Javascript, under the hood of how javascript runs it code line by line, what happens when javascript runs its code to control our computer internal features.

Then we are going to cover many of the other incredible features of Javascript;
<Features />

Finally, we will wrap up with a deep dive into the asyncronousity of javascript -
The ability of javascript to execute code out of the usual sequential order. <br/>

Instead of waiting for one operation to complete before moving on to the next, JavaScript can initiate and execute operations without blocking the rest of the code.

All of these elements tied together will give you the ability to tackle any new feature that emerges in JavaScript, and build out a performant and scalable application in your team and your development projects.
